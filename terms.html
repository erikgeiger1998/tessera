                <li>**Master Key:** You are solely responsible for remembering and maintaining the confidentiality of your Master Password, PIN, or biometric data used to unlock the App. Due to our Zero-Knowledge architecture, we cannot recover your Master Password or reset your encryption key.</li>
                <li>**Data Loss:** You acknowledge that losing your Master Key will result in the permanent inaccessibility of all encrypted data within TESSERA VAULT.</li>
                <li>**Backup:** You are responsible for ensuring your data is backed up, either through Apple's standard iCloud backup or our integrated CloudKit synchronization feature.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 matrix-text">4. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>The App is provided "as is." We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the App's security features, including the AES-256 encryption. While TESSERA VAULT uses industry-standard cryptography, no security system is impenetrable.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-300">We shall not be liable for any damages (including, but not limited to, lost data or profits) arising from the use or inability to use the App, including any compromise of your data due to loss of your Master Key or failure of external services (e.g., Apple's iCloud or third-party network outages).</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 matrix-text">5. Changes to the TOS</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300">We reserve the right to modify these TOS at any time. We will notify users of significant changes, typically by updating the effective date at the top of this document. Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new TOS.</p>
